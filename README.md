# This is a repo of tutorials for the Remix's LearnEth Plugin


### To use these tutorials:


**1. Open Remix**

https://remix.ethereum.org

**2. In the plugin manager activate LEARNETH**

**3. Go to the Learneth plugin and these tutorials will load by default**

**4. For questions**

https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-workshop

We are here to help.


**5. You may need to sign into Github**

除非您已登录 github 并输入了token，否则 Github 会阻止来自同一位置的过多请求。  This is only an issue during workshops - but because we are in a workshop, we need to do these steps:

    - 在一个浏览器窗口中 - 转到remix.ethereum.org并转到设置选项
    - In another browser window go to: 
    
    https://github.com/settings/tokens 
    
    创建新token，并将其保存在刚打开的设置选项上的 Remix 中。
